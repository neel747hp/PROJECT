Face Mask Detection

The proposed approach in this project uses deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to detect face masks in real-time. The SSDMNV2 approach uses Single Shot Multibox Detector as a face detector and MobilenetV2 architecture as a framework for the classifier, It can even be used in embedded devices (like NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry pi) to perform real-time mask detection.
